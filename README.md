# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub.
I still have a lot to learn (clearly) but in the meantime, I'll just say I like cats. 

<p>All right, I can see how this works a little better now.  This part I'm working on is a "Branch" but by typing here, I'm not changing the "Main" hello-world file. So when I hit the green "Commit changes" button in the upper right, it will propose these changes and show the additional material I'm adding now. But nothing will go through until I tell it to make the change to the "Main" page.  I'm going to have to experiment more to get used to how this works.</p>

<p>One more note to self: I was adding paragraphs because the text wasn't wrapping in my window, but when I do the preview it looks really annoying.  I'm going to type a really long sentence here and see if the text wraps. Oh it did! Ok, I'm going to remove the paragraph breaks from the above thought now.</p>
